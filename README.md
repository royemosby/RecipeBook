## About

RecipeBook is an SPA (single page application) to create and save recipes. It consists of an interface build in React with Redux and Router. To persist the recipes, it uses Ruby on Rail and PostgreSQL as an API. While it does have a username/password logon it currently only runs on a host machine.

Installation and operation READMEs are found in the [front-end](/recipe-book-frontend/README.md) and [api directories](/recipe-book-api/README.md).

## Features

This SPA will allow a user to:

- Register a new account
- View an account summary
- Create new recipes
- Edit saved recipes
- View all recipes- either as a collective of summaries or individually
- Navigate between view and edit states easily to make updates.

## Contribution

Bottom line: I will be a kind human. Please be the same in return.

Please submit a contribution idea through an issue ticket before working on a pull request. Don't submit a pull request unless it has been discussed through an
issue ticket. I happily respond to all constructive inquiries.

I will update this readme and how contributions are accepted as this project evolves.
